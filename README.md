## About
A simple batch program to help you solve your Sudoku games.
It can only solve easy and medium sudoku (for the moment) 
I made this program when I first started learning programming so my apologies if you felt offended by the algorithm.

For better graphical Visibility:

 -After openig the game > Right click on top > click on Properties > Click on Fonts > Choose "Raster Fonts" > Chose Size "8 x 12"
 - Now close the game and open it again. Done!

You can test the program by playing a game here https://sudoku.com/
